How to use the program?

First:
Compile the program using this command:
g++ Huffman.cpp CodeTable.cpp -o ex

Second:
Run the executable file to compress input.txt into output.txt
./ex input.txt output.txt c

Third:
Run the executable file to decompress output.txt into decomp.txt

Fourth:
flag can be 'c' in case of compressing or 'd' in case of decompressing

Note: 
Using different compiler may result in different result. I did run the 
program on linux virtual machine using g++ compiler, and it works just fine.
